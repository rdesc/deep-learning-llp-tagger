# Deep learning LLP tagger
This repo highlights the work I have done as part of my undergraduate thesis at UBC. The experiments outlined in my paper will not be reproducible with the scripts in this repo since the data is not meant to be shared outside of the ATLAS collaboration.

## Physics intro
Many extensions to the Standard Model (SM) suggest the existence of long lived particles (LLP) that only interact with the SM through a weakly-coupled mediator. The extended lifetime of these particle and the lack of interaction with the SM causes displaced hadronic jets in a detector. Ongoing and published research by the ATLAS collaboration, have presented machine learning models to classify displaced jets in the ATLAS calorimeters.
